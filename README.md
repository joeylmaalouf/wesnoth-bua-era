# BUA Era

## Overview

This era adds a few factions for our own personal use. There's no overall theme; they're just what we wanted to see in the game. Everything is roughly in line with the default factions, and these factions are meant to be played alongside them.

## Installation

To use this era:

* download the contents of this repository
* rename the folder containing everything to `BUA_Era`
* put that folder in [[user data](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Editingwesnoth#The_user_data_directory)]`/data/add-ons`

## GoldGuards

### Description

Despite butting heads many times in the past, modern drakes and dwarves have formed an alliance. Bonding over their shared love of gold, gemstones, and other precious treasure, these two races will do whatever it takes to defend their hoards.

### Tactics

Drakes are able to cross most terrain easily to hit their enemies hard, and dwarves are able to find good places to defend from their foes, but these units have a common weakness: they're expensive. You may not always be able to recruit a large number of units, but proper positioning will ensure that you get the most value out of your relatively strong individual units.

Offensively, you have a good mix of damage types; make sure to keep a variety of units alive, to always have the right one for the job! Your drakes will often prove a little more useful in actively giving chase and wearing down an enemy.

Defensively, make sure to get your dwarves set up in mountains and hills, while filling in any gaps in the line with your less-terrain-reliant drakes. Your dwarves will often be the key to holding an unbroken line.

## Therianthropes

### Description

Considered a curse by outsiders and a blessing by the tribes themselves, therianthropy runs in the blood of these humans. Territorial in either form, they react poorly to the presence of those they deem as invaders.

### Units

Notes: Every unit in this faction is new. The bestial human units transform into their werecreature forms at dusk, and vice-versa at dawn.

* Bestial Archer <=> Weremonkey
  * Bestial Sniper <=> Dire Weremonkey
* Bestial Charger <=> Weretiger
  * Bestial Lancer <=> Dire Weretiger
* Bestial Mage <=> Wereowl
  * Bestial Druid <=> Dire Wereowl
* Bestial Runner <=> Werefox
  * Bestial Duelist <=> Dire Werefox
* Bestial Swimmer <=> Wereserpent
  * Bestial Captain <=> Dire Wereserpent
* Bestial Swordsman <=> Werewolf
  * Bestial Commander <=> Dire Werewolf
* Bestial Trooper <=> Werebear
  * Bestial Guardian <=> Dire Werebear

### Tactics

Werecreatures are generally more mobile than their bestial human counterparts, while human tools are generally more effective in combat than natural weapons. You might find it effective to move under the cover of night and strike as day breaks.
