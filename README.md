# BUA Era

----

### Overview

This era adds a few factions for our own personal use. There's no overall theme; they're just what we wanted to see in the game. Everything is roughly in line with the default factions, and these factions are meant to be played alongside them.

To use this era:

- download the contents of this repository
- rename the folder containing everything to `BUA_Era`
- put that folder in `[your wesnoth install]\userdata\data\add-ons`
